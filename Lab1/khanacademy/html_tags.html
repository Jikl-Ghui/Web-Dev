Our universe contains atoms and not antiatoms because of a
slight 'favouritism' that prevailed at some very early stage.
This implies, of course, that a proton (or its constituent
quarks) can sometimes appear or disappear without the
same thing happening to an antiproton. There is a contrast
here with net electrical charge: this is exactly conserved, so
that if our universe started off uncharged, there would always
be an exact cancellation between positive and negative
charges.
Atoms don't live for ever, although the decay rate appears
to be incredibly low: a best guess for an atom's lifetime might
be about 1035 years. This would mean that, on average, one
atom would decay every year within a tank containing a
thousand tons of water. Experiments in the same large underground
tanks that are used to detect neutrinos cannot quite
reach this sensitivity, but already tell us that the lifetime is at
least 1033 years.</p>
