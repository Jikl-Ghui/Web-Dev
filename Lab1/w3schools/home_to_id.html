    <p>I will tell you what I like about these bosses and what I do not</p>
    <p>Just a little phrase from the game's lore:<br> 
        <pre>Memories left behind by another.
Concentrate on this memory at a Sculptor's Idol to revert the Wolf to his original appearance. 
Has no effect on ability.
Memory of Shura told via Ashina folksong: "Fields of bodies, mountains of dead.
Down Dragonspring river, our country bled.
A fiery god, demon wolf in red.

    <p>Quote from another site:</p>
    <blockquote cite="https://sekiroshadowsdietwice.wiki.fextralife.com/Bosses">
        Bosses in Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice are special, powerful Enemies that do not respawn.
        Bosses are encountered throughout the game and feature special movesets, increased health, and unique mechanics. 
        Some bosses may be optional, whilst others must be defeated to continue through the game. 
        Most Bosses have several red markers next to their Vitality bar which must be removed before the Boss can be killed, 
        each of which requires a Deathblow; a Boss' Vitality and Posture is fully restored in between Deathblows, 
        and some Bosses can gain additional moves or abilities as each Deathblow marker is removed.  
        Immediately after the final Deathblow marker is removed, a Boss must be finished off with a special Finisher Deathblow,
        which is performed like a regular Deathblow but involves Sekiro performing a special finisher animation unique to each boss.

    <p>What I like about this boss is the atmosphere. The music, the setting, everything is done to the maximum. 
        The fight itself is not very difficult, but it is very fun to ride a horse and fight a giant enemy.
        The only thing that annoys me is the long spears that he uses, which are sometimes difficult to dodge.

    <p>Lady Butterfly is one of my favorite bosses in Sekiro. 
        The fight takes place in a beautiful setting, and the music is very fitting. 
        The boss itself is very agile and uses illusions, which makes the fight more interesting.
        However, I found the second phase of the fight to be a bit frustrating due to the illusions.
